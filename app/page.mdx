title: About
---

I am currently a research fellow at the Cohen Lab at Harvard and trying to learn as much physics as possible. My goal is to build magical brain computer interfaces for humanity.

I'm most proud of the communities I helped build, like School 2.0 — a 26-person group house in New Mexico. Marley, Aayush, and I recently started a group house in Cambridge, MA — message me if you're in town and need a free place to stay or want to come for Sunday dinner!

In the past, I studied math, computer science, and a touch of physics and neuroscience at McGill. I spent most of my summers in college trying to build a low-cost ultrasound-based brain scanner, but recently put it on pause. In the past past, I loved taking part in science fairs and won 2nd place in Physics at ISEF.
