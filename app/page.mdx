My goal is to build magical brain computer interfaces that anyone can use.

I'm most proud of the communities I helped build, like [School 2.0](https://school2point0.com) — a 26-person group house in New Mexico. I recently started a [group house](https://lxm.house) with some researchy friends in San Francisco — message me if you're in town and need a free place to stay or want to come for Hot Cocoa!

I previsouly built neurotech instrumentation in [Adam Cohen's lab](https://cohenweb.rc.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard and worked on neurotech at Google X. I studied math, computer science, and physics.

Some projects:
- [Brain-controlled wheelchair](https://youtu.be/_46AoSnHCRo?si=8-TZs3gyXlF4wdYP)
- [Ventilator for COVID](https://github.com/breeze-ventilator/covid19-ventilator)
- [Coursetexts.org](https://coursetexts.org) — open sourcing Harvard/MIT courses
- [Ultrasound-based brain scanner](https://pioneer.app/winners/raffi-hotter)
- [Curius.app](https://curius.app) -- social bookmarker
