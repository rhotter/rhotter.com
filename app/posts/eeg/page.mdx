If you've ever used EEG, you've probably had trouble extracting useful signal from it. Neurotech hackers love to use it to make [cool](https://x.com/perrikaryal/status/1817597037203816541) [demos](https://youtu.be/_46AoSnHCRo?si=NU3U6fbNqZbvme5Q). But the performance of EEG is never that great and these demos never amount to anything.

Why is that? A big problem with EEG is that it has poor spatial resolution, i.e., you can't precisely determine where the neural activity is coming from. Or at least that's what people say.

I wanted to know if EEG _actually_ has poor spatial resolution. Maybe increasing the number of sensors could give it higher resolution, for example? In this post, we'll quantify from first principles the resolution of EEG.

### What even is EEG?
EEG stands for electroencephalography -- I know, that's a mouthful. Let me explain what's going on.

When neurons fire, electric charges move around, which changes the surrounding electric field. EEG probes that electric field, by measuring the voltage at many points on the head. The hardware is actually really simple -- it's the same hardware as a [multimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter) which is used for measuring voltage in an electrical circuit. The measurement is taken with an _electrode_, but really, in this context, that's just a fancy word for a wire.

I was curious about which spots of the brain the electrode is sensitive to. Intuitively, if the electrode was sensitive to only a very small region, then EEG should have high resolution. But if it's sensitive to a large area, its resolution will be lower. This is actually a subtle point, and we'll get back to it later.

So I simulated the 

I was curious about what the electric field of a neuron firing looks like? So I simulated it. I put a group of neurons inside the head (in the cortex), and simulated the voltage distribution on the scalp.

To make our life simple, we'll use the [spherical cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow) model for neuroscience. We'll treat the head as a sphere that consists of a few layers: the brain, the skull, and the scalp.

We can then view EEG as a sampling of the voltage of the outermost sphere, the scalp.
