If you've ever used EEG, you've probably had trouble extracting useful signal from it. Neurotech hackers love to use it to make [cool](https://x.com/perrikaryal/status/1817597037203816541) [demos](https://youtu.be/_46AoSnHCRo?si=NU3U6fbNqZbvme5Q). But the performance of EEG is never that great and these demos never amount to anything.

The problem with EEG is that it has poor spatial resolution, i.e., you can't precisely determine where the neural activity is coming from. Or at least that's what people say.

I wanted to know if EEG actually has poor spatial resolution. Maybe increasing the number of sensors could give it higher resolution? In this post, we'll quantify from first principles the resolution of EEG.

### What even is EEG?
EEG stands for electroencephalography (I know, that's a mouthful). It's essentially a bunch of [multimeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter) on the head. Each sensor measures the voltage between a point on the head and a reference point (typically the ear).

How does measuring voltage on the head tell us about brain activity?

Well, neurons have 

To make our life simple, we'll use the [spherical cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow) model for neuroscience. We'll treat the head as a sphere that consists of a few layers: the brain, the skull, and the scalp.

We can then view EEG as a sampling of the voltage of the outermost sphere, the scalp.
