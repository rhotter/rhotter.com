If you've ever used EEG, you've probably had a lot of trouble extracting useful signal from it. Neurotech hackers love to use it to make cool demos (for example, I was part of a team at McGill that made a [brain-controlled wheelchair](https://youtu.be/_46AoSnHCRo?si=NU3U6fbNqZbvme5Q)).

But the performance of EEG never seems that great and these demos never amount to anything.

Why? Many people claim that EEG has "bad spatial resolution." Indeed, that would contribute to the signal quality being bad. But how bad is bad? What if you drastically increase the number of sensors?

In this post, we'll quantify from first principles the resolution of EEG.

### What even is EEG?
EEG stands for electroencephalography. It's essentially a bunch of [multimeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter) on the head. Each sensor measures the voltage between points on the head and a reference point (typically the ear).

To make our life simple, we'll use the [spherical cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow) model for neuroscience. We'll treat the head as a sphere that consists of a few layers: the brain, the skull, and the scalp.

We can then view EEG as a sampling of the voltage of the outermost sphere, the scalp.
