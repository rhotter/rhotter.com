#### What are spherical harmonics?
Spherical harmonics show up in many places! They represent the [electron orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital) in a Hydrogen atom, and are used in domains like [computer graphics](https://www.ppsloan.org/publications/StupidSH36.pdf)!

I like to think of spherical harmonics as being like the Fourier basis. The parameter $l$ is analogous to the wavenumber $k$ in the Fourier basis — higher $l$ means more peaks. The parameter $m$ tells you [how those peaks are distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics#Visualization_of_the_spherical_harmonics) between the two axes. Try it!

The difference between the spherical harmonics and the Fourier basis is that the Fourier basis is for functions defined on the real line or on a circle, and the spherical harmonics are for functions defined on a sphere.

Just like how you can represent any real-valued function as a sum of functions from the fourier basis, you can do the same with spherical harmonics for functions defined on the sphere.

For the more mathematically sophisticated — the deeper mathematical connection between the Fourier basis and the spherical harmonics is that they're both eigenfunctions of the [Laplace-Beltrami operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%E2%80%93Beltrami_operator).
